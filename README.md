# Machine Learning Projects and Data Analaysis
This repository contains several short machine learning projects to demonstrate some of the topics that I have familiarity with.

The Jupyter Notebooks cover:
- Data Visualization, Linear Models, and Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks
- Trees, Forests, and XGBoost
- Working with Imbalanced Datasets

The directory NN_and_PCA_from_scratch contains python files implementing and testing neural networks and principal component analysis from scratch.

Note, this list is not exhaustive of my ML experience :)
