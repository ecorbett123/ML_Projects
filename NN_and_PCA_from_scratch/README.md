# Feedforward Neural Network and PCA from Scratch

This repository contains a Python implementation of a feedforward neural network built from scratch using NumPy. The implementation does not rely on deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, allowing users to understand the underlying mechanics of neural networks.

It also contains an implementation of principal component analysis (PCA) from scratch, implemented on a dataset resembling a swiss roll. 

## Features of NN
- Customizable number of layers and neurons per layer
- Sigmoid as activation function
- Forward and backward propagation
- Gradient descent optimization
- Mean Squared Error Loss functions 
- Training and evaluation support
